{"name":"Datatune","tagline":"DataTune was the first data cleansing system, developed by Michael Haephrati between 2001 and 2003","body":"DataTune was one of the first data cleansing systems, developed during 2000-2003 by Target Eye LTD, UK, a software venture founded by [[Michael Haephrati]]. Datatune was discontinued in 2003.\r\n![DataTune ad published at www.pc.co.il](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/DataTune_Ad.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Features**\r\n\r\nDataTune has error correction and data cleansing mechanisms based on several sources and algorithms that were new at the time they were first introduced. DataTune was developed using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0. It contained the software part and several MS Access databases. DataTune was developed under the assumption that data cleansing should be performed partially automatically, and right after, all Rejects and Exceptions must be reviewed manually. DataTune had automatic processes which perform the cleansing and estimate the level of accuracy of each cleansed record. Records with low expected accuracy are defined as \"Rejects\" and are sent to a queue for human processing.\r\n\r\n![DataTune settings screen](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Datatune-project-settings-screen.png)\r\n\r\n**DataTune data cleansing system**\r\nComparing records with an Error Bank, which holds typical errors, and is expanded during each data cleansing project. For example, if one of the records accessed holds the city name \"Ney York\", the DataTune system replaces it with \"New York City\"\r\nComparing records with public domain data sources. Such data sources may contain official lists of countries, cities, addresses, locations, etc.\r\nUniting records, using a pre-defined format, such as : House Number + Street Name, for a Street Address, modifying all records to meet the same structure.\r\nUsing Soundex based algorithm for all searches, ensuring that typical replacements between common characters (such as 'c' instead of 's' and vice versa) and tracked and fixed.\r\nUsing databases provided by the customers - these databases were used for cross-checking the various fields and records.\r\nSeparation of fields - In several databases different fields are kept as a single field. For example, a customer's address can be stored as “350 Elm Street. Suite #35”), will be replaced with separate fields: Street Name: \"Elm Street\", House Number: \"350\", Additional Address Data: \"Suite #35\".\r\n\r\n![DataTune main screen](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/DataTune.png)\r\n\r\nDataTune was used by many mid - enterprise companies, including Microsoft (Israel)\r\n![Contract with Microsoft](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Datatune_service_agreement_-_Microsoft_2002.jpg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
